## LowGuessrateSongManager
Script to manage low guess rate songs in a window. 

- Only works with LowGuessRateSongTracker and Song History script by Minigamer42
- You can list all the added songs and delete the ones you don't want to keep

## LowGuessrateSongTracker

Script to automatically add the low guess rate songs in the local storage

Once a song is played and has a guess rate of 33.33% or less with a minimum of 3 times played, it will be added to the local storage.

If the song has a higher guess rate than 33.33% and was in local storage, it will be removed from it.

## Special character shortcut

Script mainly used for no dropdown game mod that allows you to write special characters quickly using "alt + <number>".

Does not work in Song/artist room for now.


## Future scripts and ideas 
- Local Storage Json generator : A script to generate a Json file using local storage. Could be useful to make Json files based on low guess rate songs

- Automatic download songs script : A script to download all songs in a JSON to your computer and rename
